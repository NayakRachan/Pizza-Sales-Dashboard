### 5.	Features / Highlights
A fast-growing pizza outlet lacked a centralized and visual approach to track sales, identify top-selling items, and monitor customer behavior.
Manual data analysis made it difficult for managers to quickly understand performance trends and make data-driven decisions.

Key questions included:
Which pizza categories are most popular?
What days or hours generate the most sales?
Who are the top customers and how do their orders impact revenue?
Which items are underperforming or overperforming?
